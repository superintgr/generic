## the computation proceeds in the steps of finite duration and only a finite portion of the substrate attributes are used
## it is asserted that information storage is unlimited via constructions made from processing substrates which are reversible computers
## the checkpoints of existing models will be available while new layer of information must instantiate a new model checkpoint
