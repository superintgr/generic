# if an intrinsic attribute implies another intrinsic attribute for both properties under union operation, there exists a substrate whose extrinsic properties imply a pair of possible intrinsic state
# if an extrinsic state is an implication of operation performed on some physical variable and logical operator, there exists a physical quantity which never change under the same contructive transformation
# if some physical quantity is kept invarient via combinations of logical and physical attributes some substrate, there exists a physical variable which must remain in existence for yielding other measurable quantities
# if some measurable quantity that stays invarient undet the transformation applied on physical state of a substrate whose measure is implicated from the corresponding logical states, then the transformation implies some abstract state
# when some abstract state of a system which is composed of subsystems whose intrinsic and extrinsic measures correspond to logical and physical interoperability criterion of each of their composite substructures, the super-structure uniting those substrates produce information variable
# an information variable implies information media with reversible dynamics, therefore such dynamical laws encorporate the static properties on which abstract varible is imposed.
