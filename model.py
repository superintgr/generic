# models include [mono channel, stereo channel, balanced connection, phantom group, line mixer, channel mixer]

# characteristic programs of the model:
# . (computing state), (preparation of attributes)
# . (measurement of properties), (constructing state)

# a physical object is assigned to a model
# the buffers map device state with respect to the channel capacity of the model using memory mapping of physical variables
# new model will go through registering named buffers with parameters that remain attached for all relations
# the parameters of the model are not all mutable and any adjustments require a standard criterion predefined in the state dict.

### EXAMPLE ###
system = Stereo(..)
agent = Stereo(..)

medium = LineMixer(system, agent)

computation, construction = medium(agent), agent(system)
measurement, preparation = system(construction), medium(system)
