(A) -> (D) : Interest -> Impulse
(B) -> (C) : Code -> Potential

Potential : whether the impulse vector will carry on the same interest forward or add a different potential in place that was previously seen

Interest : often is around what has been previously interested with but couldn't get a closure from work done around the impulse

Impulse : could be directly converted to a potential for recurring staticity or the interest started with will get successfully translated forward

Code : any activity in coding environment consist of writing plain text, running previously seen code, getting help from bot, seeing if code runs, or finish part of an existing plan before moving forward

.. Interest: There are specific interests around how code should be and what I would like to do about it
.. Impulse: Usually starts with a pytorch model so that I could build a basis for my development

.. Code: Writing that code is difficult because I don't like and have training samples for foundational type

.. Potential: Usually would like to continue on my own plan which has to replace the usual method and I have to build it in my terms
